Ken & Olaf (KO) invented the KO Count, the world's first unbalanced card counting system. It was revolutionary, as it did not
require a "true count conversion". Determining whether you had an advantage over the house no longer required dividing by the
number of unseen decks. You only needed to keep a simple running count to assert your advantage over the casinos.
